# Simple Website Demo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I created this demo website to highlight some of React's capabilities and learn more about them.  Created a responsive website, with a header, footer, and a minimal yet modern UI. I used mostly ReactJS, and CSS.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
