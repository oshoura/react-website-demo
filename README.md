# Simple React Website Demo

I created this demo website to highlight some of React's capabilities and learn more about them.  Created a responsive website, with a header, footer, and a minimal yet modern UI. I used mostly ReactJS, and CSS.

I built it following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2UBjN5ER4s)
